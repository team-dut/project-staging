# How to run

- If you are insist on running from source: open this project with an IDE (we recommend IntelliJ) then run as usual.

- If you are on Windows: head to Releases page of GitHub (https://github.com/team-dut/project-staging/releases), install the .zip file, extract it, run the Game.exe file.

- If you do not want to risk the security: follow the above guide, then run the .jar instead.
    java -jar Game.jar

# Note

- Please make sure the resources directory is in the same place with the .jar or .exe file, that is:
    resources/
    Game.jar
    Game.exe
